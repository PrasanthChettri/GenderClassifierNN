# A convo2d and LSTM approach for classifiying gender from names

By finding feminine and masculine traits and patterns in name

What I learned

* This is weirdly similar to time series prediction
* convolution is not that great for classifying text for this sort of classification
* LSTMS work very decently and preform far better than CNNs
